      <p><strong>OUR GENERAL PHILOSOPHY</strong><br />
The internship/apprenticeship is, at its core, a working/learning experience. The primary<br />
method for learning about farming  throughout history has been hands-on and experiential. We firmly believe this still to be true and relevant.  All work assignments are made within the context of working as a team within a family with young children, and as part of the overall farm operations. Our farm depends on mutual cooperation and willingness to help one another accomplish the overall goals of a successful season and higher goal of the financial sustainability of the farm.</p>
<p><strong>OUR WORK ETHIC</strong><br />
Farming is a mix of working hard and smart. Each individual should continually strive to find<br />
a balance between speed and efficiency, and balancing an eye for details while maintaining<br />
a grasp of the greater vision of the farm, the staff, and the season as a whole. There are a<br />
finite number of days and hours in the season the get our work done; a positive attitude,<br />
enthusiasm, clear communication, a strong work ethic and endurance during long hours in all<br />
types of weather and sincere interest in sustainable agriculture are all very important to<br />
everyone on the farm.  </p>
<p><strong>WORK AGREEMENT</strong><br />
Apprentices and interns work in all aspects of the farm's production, from seeding,<br />
transplanting, nursery propagation, irrigation, bed preparation and cultivation, composting,<br />
pest management, harvesting, post-harvest processing, and marketing. During the course of the<br />
season, apprentices and interns are given the information and time to learn about farming's<br />
many aspects.</p>
<p><strong>WORK SCHEDULE </strong></p>
<p>1. The schedule of the position for the season is May through the end of November. Interns are expected to work 6 hours a week. Apprentices are expected to work 16 hours a week. We will take a daily mid-break for lunch and discussion.</p>
<p>2. Specific hours will be determined on a case-by-case basis and influenced by the needs of the farm. Thursdays and Fridays are our highest priority, as it is our major harvest/market day. We sell at 3 farmers market during the week.</p>
<p>3. If time off is needed, at least 2 weeks notice is preferred. We use a calendar in the<br />
shed to stay on top of scheduled time-off. </p>
<p>4. Apprentices and interns will contribute to the weekly CSA Newsletter. This may range<br />
from providing a written reflection, recipes, online videos, or articles. </p>
<p><strong>MONTHLY MEETINGS</strong> (for Apprentices only)<br />
Every day (often during lunch) , we will make time for checking in. The main points are to review the past month of work, make time for feedback and questions, address any requests for time-off and/or schedule changes, self-evaluations, and reviewing upcoming priorities for the farm.</p>
<p><strong>SAFETY &amp; COMMON SENSE </strong></p>
<p>• We discourage open-toe footwear and being barefoot as there are many sharp tools,<br />
nails, glass, staples, sticks, and the like at the farm that can be a hazard. We suggest<br />
being prepared with some tall, waterproof boots. The farm can be very wet and muddy, sometimes very hot, sometimes extremely cold or windy.</p>
<p>• It is easy to set tools down in the field and forget about them. Common things that are<br />
put down and forgotten are harvest knives, rubber bands, and hand tools during harvest<br />
days and other busy days. Always be aware of what you've brought out and be sure to<br />
put it back in its place, as its less of a headache for everyone else later on. We should<br />
help remind each other of this when we see it happen. </p>
<p>• If for some reason things have to be left out and you aren't sure you'll return, notify<br />
someone else to handle it. We encourage everyone to take ownership over common work<br />
areas and help each other keep the farm tidy.</p>
<p>• Bring a water bottle and keep it full, plus snacks, a hat, sunglasses, sunscreen and proper clothes. We will have to work in all types of situations and keeping tabs on these little things pays off. The sun and humidity in the summer can be especially harsh. When the forecast<br />
calls for a brutally hot day, we may start extra early to be able to break in the middle of the<br />
heat and resume in the afternoon.</p>
<p>• Familiarize yourself with the location of the First Aid Kit. Alert the staff to any farm injuries immediately. Be aware of your limitations. Stretching in the morning is a great habit to keep you farming for years to come. Keep proper posture when lifting, use your stronger leg muscles and don’t hesitate to ask for help.</p>
<p><strong>COMPENSATION </strong></p>
<p>1. Apprentices will receive a weekly CSA share, and a weekly $20 travel stipend. We currently<br />
cannot provide any monetary compensation to interns but you may help yourself to any produce on the farm. </p>
<p>2. Any classes/workshops given or hosted by Five Seeds Farms is free to apprentices and interns.</p>
<p>3. We are willing to help students obtain credit for their apprenticeship/internship, whenever appropriate and possible.</p>
<p><strong>SPECIAL PROJECTS</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes, apprentices and interns have a particular interest on the farm and want to<br />
develop a project outside of the normal day-to-day routine of the farm. We are happy to<br />
consider these projects. Below, you will find a protocol to help us determine if it is a good fit for the farm:</p>
<p>Please submit in writing to farm management  a document detailing the following:<br />
- a description of the project<br />
- your perspective of the the short-term and long-term goals to the farm<br />
- how this project will benefit the farm<br />
- a proposed budget to fund the project and projected needs to operate it for the next 3 seasons<br />
- what materials are needed to complete the project<br />
- what is the time commitment anticipated<br />
- potential partners<br />
- required research</p>
<p><strong>EDUCATION </strong></p>
<p>1. As previously stated, we primarily learn through hands-on experience. We will do our best<br />
to explain the why behind what we do, while still balancing the need to accomplish tasks in a timely manner.</p>
<p>2. We will also provide you with access to resources to explore topics in depth that may interest you further. Apprentices and interns will receive a binder at the beginning with<br />
different monthly topics and associated readings. We can tailor readings and informal<br />
lessons to specific interests of the Interns. We will provide updates on workshops,<br />
conferences and other events held during the season.  There are several organizations that we find inspirational and educational,  like Future Harvest-CASA (Chesapeake Alliance for Sustainable Agriculture), PASA (Pennsylvania Association of Sustainable Agriculture), SAAFON (Southeastern African-American Organic Network) and others regularly offer events that we fill would greatly benefit you on your journey in agriculture.  We'll also provide a list of<br />
farms that you should visit.</p>
<p>3. Upon the start of the season, every apprentice and intern will be expected to provide a list of goals for the season, as well as your own plan of action for achieving them. We are here to<br />
assist you in your learning, however you are ultimately responsible. We will meet over<br />
the course of the season to see if those goals are being met, or have changed, and to<br />
establish ways in which we can help you to meet those goals. The farm has a small<br />
library, which apprentices and interns should responsibly utilize and contribute to (if they feel led to).</p>
<p>4. The resources and possibilities for learning on the farm are endless, but ultimately you will<br />
get out of the experience what you put into it. This is your opportunity to explore. Although<br />
no one should expect to learn everything about farming in one year (or ever, for that matter), there are always opportunities to learn. It is important to remember that even the<br />
most mundane tasks can teach us something, and that the season needs to be looked at in its entirety. A great tool for your journey is a journal to keep notes in and document your time here with us .</p>
<p>5. You will be provided with a small notepad for taking notes, keeping track of tasks, recording instructions, and writing observations. </p>
<p><strong>OTHER PERSONNEL POLICIES &amp; PROCEDURES </strong></p>
<p>1. Evaluations and Conflict Resolution</p>
<p>• Apprentices will be have intentional time set aside for checking in. We expect an<br />
exchange of feedback- we want to hear your views on the experience. In preparation<br />
of each check-in, there will be a self-evaluation form to fill out.</p>
<p>• Exchanging feedback regularly, when respectful, promotes a healthy way of dealing<br />
with problems as they arise and contributes to the success of the farm. Although the<br />
season will become very busy, please address concerns as they come up and use the<br />
monthly check-ins. Please do not assume we know how you are feeling- you must<br />
communicate.</p>
<p>2. General Demeanor and Schedules and Breaks</p>
<p>• It is expected that everyone arrive on time, or better yet, a few minutes early, dressed<br />
appropriately and prepared to work. </p>
<p>• We should all work to keep maintain an environment free from discrimination,<br />
harassment, and offensive and degrading remarks.</p>
<p>• If you are sick, please rest. Let us know what's going on in a timely manner. </p>
<p>• If you have to arrive late, we need to know as soon as possible. However, don’t make<br />
it a habit. This is an interdependent relationship. We need you. Communicate to us any special circumstances that may prevent you from being consistently on-time.</p>
<p>• Generally, we break at 12 for an hour lunch. On harvest days, this may need to get<br />
pushed a little later if the harvest takes longer.</p>
<p>• Please, keep phone use limited to important calls. It can be distracting and affect our work flow and sanity. </p>
<p>• We generally don't allow pets at the farm, as they can be distracting and dangerous to small children and working animals. All the animals that live on or near the farm that we care for are seen as part of the production system or overall ecological system of the farm. Visiting animals can disrupt that balance.</p>
<p>• We are a family-owned and operated farm that operates as a small business. We believe that collective work, sharing knowledge and fellowship will continue the legacy of farming. We want people to visit the farm, talk and work with us and learn. However, please bring visitors after work is complete. We appreciate everyone's willingness to volunteer, but we haven't trained them and we have specific hours for general volunteering.</p>
<p>• The farm's trucks are reserved for the purposes of the farm, not for personal use unless it is an emergency.</p>
